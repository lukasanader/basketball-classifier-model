df = fetch_last_n_seasons(n=8)
df.to_csv('data/games.csv', index=False)
```

### **Model Training**
```python
# Train prediction model with automated feature engineering
from model_training import load_dataset, train_model

# Load data and train model with built-in data leakage prevention
df = load_dataset('nba_game_dataset.csv')
model, features, importances = train_model(df)

# Automated model persistence for deployment
joblib.dump(model, 'nba_model.pkl')
```

### **Feature Analysis**
```python
# Analyze feature importance and model performance
from model_training import plot_feature_importance

# Visualize top predictive features
plot_feature_importance(features, importances, top_n=20)
```
